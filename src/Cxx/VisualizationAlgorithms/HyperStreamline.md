### Description
This is an example of hyperstreamlines. The data is from a point load applied to semi-infinite domain. Compare this image to [TensorEllipsoids](/Cxx/VisualizationAlgorithms/TensorEllipsoids) that used tensor ellipsoids to visualize the same data. Notice that there is less clutter and more information available from the hyperstreamline visualization.
