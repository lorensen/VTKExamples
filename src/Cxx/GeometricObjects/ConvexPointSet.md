### Description

vtkConvexPointSet object represents a 3D cell defined by a convex set of points. An example of such a cell is an octant (from an octree). 

vtkConvexPointSet uses the ordered triangulations approach (vtkOrderedTriangulator) to create triangulations guaranteed to be compatible across shared faces.
