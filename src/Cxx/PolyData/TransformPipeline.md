### Description
This example demonstrate how to connect a transformation for keeping coordinate one actor relative to another. I used a robotic arm because it's good example used originally by James D. Foley in book: Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice in C. Someone who read this book may want to know how to make it in VTK.
