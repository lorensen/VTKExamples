### Description
This example uses vtkPolyDataConnectivityFilter to keep the largest connected region of a mesh. Note that this is based on the number of points, not the actual area of the region.

The original vtkPolyData is red, on top. The extracted region is yellow, on the bottom.

!!! note
    Contrast this with [PolyDataConnectivityFilter_SpecifiedRegion](/Cxx/PolyData/PolyDataConnectivityFilter_SpecifiedRegion).
