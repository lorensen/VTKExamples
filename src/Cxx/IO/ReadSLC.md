In this exercise you will familiarize yourself with the stages required to read a .slc file and create a visualization pipeline in VTK. 
Following is the three step procedure:
Step 1: Read the data from .slc file using vtkSLCReader object
Step 2: Implement Marching cubes Algorithm using vtkContourFilter Object 
Step 3: Create Visualization pipeline to visualize data using an actor, mapper and rendering window
