### Description
This example demonstrates how to create a filter that accepts a custom class and returns a custom class. To test that it is working, the class vtkTest simply stores a double named 'Value' that is instantiated to the value of 4.5. Example.cxx instantiates a vtkTest and sets its value to 5.6. The filter adds 1.0 to this value, so the vtkTest that is the output of the vtkTestAlgorithmFilter should contain the value 6.6.
