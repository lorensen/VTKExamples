### Description
This example demonstrates how to setup the pipeline for a {{class|vtkImageAlgorithm}} filter that takes a {{class|vtkImageData}} as input and produces another vtkImageData as output. This particular example creates a 2x2 image and fills it with "2"s. The filter changes the (0,0) element to a 5.
