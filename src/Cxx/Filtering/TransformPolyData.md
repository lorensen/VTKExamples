### Description
This example demonstrates how to apply a transform to a data set. It
uses vtkTransformPolyDataFilter, but it can be replaced with
vtkTransformFilter for different types of data sets,
including vtkUnstructuredGrid and
vtkStructuredGrid. vtkTransformFilter will work
with vtkPolyData, too).
