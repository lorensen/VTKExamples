### Description
Perform a 2D Delaunay triangulation respecting a specified boundary. This examples constructs a 10x10 grid of points. It then defines a polygon that uses the points in the grid. We want to triangulate all of the points except the region inside the boundary of the polygon. We expect a rectangular hole of size 4x3 in the resulting triangulated plane.
