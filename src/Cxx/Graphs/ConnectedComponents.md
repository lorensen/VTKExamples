### Description
This example constructs a graph with 4 vertices and 2 edges. V1 and V2 are not connected to V3 or V4. We wish to obtain all of the connected components of the graph. The output of the example is a list of component IDs. All vertices with the same ID can be reached from any vertex with the same ID.
