### Description
This example demonstrates how to use vtkSeedWidget, which generates (seeds) points to be placed in the scene in the locations where the user clicks.

The points can then be used for operations like connectivity, segmentation, and region growing. For an example using a custom callback where such operations can be assembled, see [SeedWidgetWithCustomCallback](/Cxx/Widgets/SeedWidgetWithCustomCallback).
