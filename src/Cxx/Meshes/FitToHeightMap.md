### Description

This example uses vtkFitToHeightMapFilter to cover a height map with vtkPolyData generated by a vtkPlaneSource. The plane's origin, point1 and point2 are calculated from the DEM's bounding box. The z coordinate of each parameter is set to the height of the DEM. With this plane, the example uses vtkProbeFilter to apply the scalar elevation data from the DEM.

vtkWarpScalar is used to "elevate" the DEM mesh. Once he planes are draped over the warped DEM mesh, they are displayed side-by-side using the same vtkLookupTable.

The displayed meshes are original (left), point fit (middle) and cell fit (right).

!!! note
    DEM files for the United States are available [here](https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/pub/data/DEM/250/).

!!! info
    This example requires vtk version 8.2 or newer.
