### Description
This example uses Quadric Clustering, based on the work of Garland and Heckbert who first presented the quadric error measure at Siggraph '97 ["Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics"](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/meshpapers/GarlandHeckbert2.pdf). For details of the algorithm
Michael Garland's Ph.D. thesis is also recommended. Hughues Hoppe's Vis
'99 paper, ["New Quadric Metric for Simplifying Meshes with Appearance Attributes"](http://hhoppe.com/newqem.pdf) is also a good take on the subject especially as it pertains to the error metric applied to attributes.
