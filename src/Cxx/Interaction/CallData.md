### Description
This example demonstrates the use of 'calldata' in a vtkCallbackCommand. Here, we create a custom VTK filter to invoke an event to which we attach a value (the 'calldata'). We use a timer to modify and update the filter so that the event is triggered repeatedly, demonstrating the pass-via-calldata.
