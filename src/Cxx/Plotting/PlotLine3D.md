### Description

This example illustrates plotting 3D points using vtkPlotLine3D. It plots the solution to the [Lorenz Attractor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system).

!!! warning
    The current vtkPlotLine3D produces the warning, "vtkOpenGLContextDevice3D (): a line width has been requested that is larger than your system supports" which appears to have no effect on the results.
