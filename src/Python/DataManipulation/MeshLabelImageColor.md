### Description
This example takes a label image in Meta format and meshes a single label of it. It then smooths the mesh and colours the vertices according to the displacement error introduced by the smoothing. The whole thing is then displayed. Example data can be found here [labels.tgz](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/images/2/23/Labels.tgz).
