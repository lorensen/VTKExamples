Java Program to Visualize a Triangle Strip.

The triangle strip is a composite two-dimensional cell consisting of one or more triangles. 
The points defining the triangle strip need not lie in a plane. 
The triangle strip is defined by an ordered list of n+2 points, where n is the number of triangles.
The ordering of the points is such that each set of three points defines a triangle.
